## Course notes

- What is logic?
According to the Aur√©lio dictionary, logic is the coherence of reasoning, ideas, or even the coherent, regular and necessary sequence of events, things.

- Programming logic:
Programming logic just means to contextualize the logic in computer programming, looking for the best sequence of actions to solve a problem.

- Metacognition:
Think like you think.

- Abstraction:
It is the ability to focus on the essential aspects of any context, ignoring less important or accidental features.

- Algorithm:
Is a sequence of steps that solves a problem.

- Pseudocode:
It is a generic way of writing an algorithm, using a simple language for the person who writes it, in order to be understood by anyone.

- Flowcharts:
It is a tool used to graphically represent the algorithm, that is, the logical sequence of the data flow.
It is a kind of diagram and can be understood as a schematic representation of a process.
We can understand it, in practice, as the documentation of the steps necessary to carry out any process.

- Variables:
In programming, a variable is an object (a position, often located in memory) capable of holding and representing a value or expression.
A variable is a space in the computer's memory destined to data that is changed during the execution of the algorithm.

- Constants:
They are immutable values and are not changed during the lifetime of the program.

- Data types:
Variables and constants can be basically classified into four types: numeric, character, alphanumeric or logical.

- Arithmetic Expressions:
These are expressions that use arithmetic operators and functions involving constants and variables.

- Literal Expressions:
These are expressions with constants and/or variables that result in literal values.
