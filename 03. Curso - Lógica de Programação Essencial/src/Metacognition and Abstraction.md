# Metacognition and Abstraction in the practice

For example:
You have a problem that would be buying two shirts. 
For that, you went to the store and found that each one costs R$50.

T-shirt1 | T-shirt2
----- | -----
Price(?) | Price(?)

You found out that each one costs R$50. 
Soon, you will pay R$100 for the two shirts.

T-shirt1 | T-shirt2 | Total
:----- | :-----: | -----:
R$50 | R$50 | R$100

But the seller told you that by taking two shirts you will get a 20% discount.

T-shirt1 | T-shirt2 | Total | Discount
:----- | :-----: | :-----: | -----:
R$50 | R$50 | R$100 | 20%

With this discount information, you will calculate how much you will save on this purchase. 
For this you take the total value and multiply it by the fraction 20/100
and find that the discount amount was R$20.

T-shirt1 | T-shirt2 | Total | Discount | Discount (R$)
:-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----:
R$50 | R$50 | R$100 | 20% | R$20

That way, you can already know how much you will pay in the end.
It was R$100, but with the R$20 discount, you only need to shell out R$80 for the two shirts.

T-shirt1 | T-shirt2 | Total | Discount | Discount (R$) | Total to pay 
:-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----:
R$50 | R$50 | R$100 | 20% | R$20 | R$80

In the example above, the entire mental map of the situation was created.
All information needed to resolve this issue has been taken.

But would it be possible to shorten the resolution of this problem?
For sure!

Knowing that the final price was E$100 and that if the discount was 20%, 
you would only pay 80% of that amount.
So you could multiply the initial value by 0.8 (80/100) 
and you would find the final value of R$80 in the same way.

Total | Remainder of discount | Total to pay
:-----: | :-----: | :-----:
R$100 | 80% | R$80

Thus, two ways of solving the same problem were presented, 
one using a larger mental map and the other removing unnecessary information.

So we learn what Abstraction is.
