## Create an algorithm of your day.

Start - day
    wake up early
    I say good morning to my wife
    Kiss her belly
    I say hi to Otto
    I get up from bed
    Change of clothes
    Brush my teeth
    I see what I need to do on the day
    Start my work
    I have breakfast
    I go back to work
    Stop for lunch
    I turn on the TV
    I put it in the local newspaper
    Eat my lunch
    Brush my teeth
    Rest a little
    I go back to work
    I leave work
    I take a shower
    I see what to do the other day
    I watch TV beside my wife
    I talk to her
    Eat my dinner
    I make plans
    Brush my teeth
    I go to bed
    I sleep
Finish - day
