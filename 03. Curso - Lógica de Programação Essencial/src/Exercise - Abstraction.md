# Abstraction exercise

Create a mind map to solve a particular problem, for example, 
calculate the arithmetic average of 4 grades, knowing that the grades are as follows:

Grade 1: 5
Grade 2: 7
Grade 3: 10
Grade 4: 3

After discovering the first solution, you will ask yourself a question: 
is it possible to make an abstraction from your mind map?

## 1st way

You have the first note, the second, the third and the fourth.
You add them all up and note that the total score is 25.

Grade 1 | Grade 2 | Grade 3 | Grade 4 
:-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: 
5 | 7 | 10 | 3 | 25 

You can also see that the scores of 4 tests were added.

Grade 1 | Grade 2 | Grade 3 | Grade 4 | Total | Number of grades
:-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----:
5 | 7 | 10 | 3 | 25 | 4 

And to calculate the final average, you need to divide your total grade by the amount of tests.
When calculating, you find that the final average is 6.25.

Grade 1 | Grade 2 | Grade 3 | Grade 4 | Total | Number of grades | Average
:-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----:
5 | 7 | 10 | 3 | 25 | 4 | 6.25

## 2nd way

You add up the total of your grades and divide by the number of tests, 
this value is your final average.

Total | Number of grades | Average
:-----: | :-----: | :-----: 
25 | 4 | 6.25
