# Flowchart, variables, constants and data types in the practice

## Flowcharts

## Variables

Example of representation of the variables that are involved in solving the averaging problem:

Start
    DECLARES grade1: number
    DECLARES grade2: number
    DECLARES grade3: number
    DECLARES grade4: number
    DECLARES media: number
    READ (grade1)
    READ (grade2)
    READ (grade3)
    READ (grade4)
    media = (grade1+grade2+grade3+grade4)/4
    PRINT (media)
End

## Constants

Example of representation of the constant and variables that are involved in solving a problem:

Start
    DECLARES pi = 3,14
    DECLARES radius: number
End
