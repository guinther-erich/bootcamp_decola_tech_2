# Algorithm and Pseudocode in the practice

For example:
Step by step of your daily activities.

Start - day
    I woke up
    I got up from bed
    I changed my clothes
    I brushed my teeth
    I went to the bakery
    I had breakfast
    I brushed my teeth
    I went to work
    ...
End - day

It is extremely important to define the beginning and end 
of a problem so that the path is drawn.

## Code.org

It is a website aimed at teaching programming for beginners.
There are a series of challenges in it that need to be resolved 
with a series of actions.

## Wolf, Sheep and Cabbage Game

It's a logic game in which you have to transport the wolf, 
the sheep and the cabbage from one bank of the river to the other.
But during this crossing there are rules to be followed, such as: 
you cannot leave the wolf alone with the sheep, nor the sheep alone with the cabbage.

If we were to describe the actions of this game in pseudocode, it would look like this:

Start the game
    Sheep enter in the boat
    The boat crosses the river
    Sheep leave the boat
    The boat crosses the river
    ...
End game
